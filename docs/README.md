## 1. Introduction

When starting to develop a game, designers should start by thinking about the main emotions/ideas it tries to make players feel. It is recommended to have from 3 to 8 game pillars. Having too many pillars will confuse players, and as developers, we can't translate them effectively into emotions. When working as a team, it is recommended to have a set of objectives to accomplish.

Game pillars are the point of reference of game mechanics. In order to make players feel the desired emotions, mechanics that don't revolve around the pillars should be scrapped or, at least, should not be important. 

### Game Design Pillars vs Key Selling Points

First, we need to define what Key Selling Points are. Some game features provide a clear benefit to the player, so communicating those features to the customers can increase the potential number of players.

Although most Game Pillars are Key Selling Points, exposing some Game Pillars can be detrimental for your game. For example, if one of the Game Pillars of a sequel is "Improving bad features from the previous game", it shouldn't become a KSP. Another example of a common hidden Pillar in "Hardcore" games is "accessibility". Their playerbase usually consider accessibility as "making the game easier", thus disliking the game.

## Example Games and Pillars

### Resident Evil 4

- Challenging

### Diablo III

Diablo III has seven main Pillars, as told by Jay Wilson (game director), which are

- Approachable
- Powerful Heroes
- Highly Customizable
- Great Item Game
- Endlessly Replayable
- Strong Setting
- Cooperative Multiplayer

A survey was given to 3000 Diablo III players to ask which ones were done well. The results were quite interesting, having only 2 Pillars accomplished by the majority of players, according to players.

- Approachable (70% voted YES)
- Powerful Heroes (50% voted YES)
- Strong Setting (25% voted YES)
- Cooperative Multiplayer (20% voted YES)
- Highly Customizable (10% voted YES)
- Endlessly Replayable (10% voted YES)
- Great Item Game (5% voted YES)

It is also remarkable that only 75 out of the 3000 voters thought that all Design Pillars were done well, against the 600 votes thinking none were done well).
